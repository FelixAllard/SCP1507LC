# SCP 1507: The Flamingo Army Mod for Lethal Company
This is a Comission I made for JoeJoe on discord. The concept was entirely his, but the implementation is mine and was designed by me!
### Table of Contents
This monster is created quite differently from different modded monster so do be careful if you plan on modding this mod!
There is actually 2 monsters in this mod which are Alpha Flamingo and the flamingo instances. The Alpha flamingo utilise the SCP1507 Manager to manage all the flamingo instances at once without having to fetch them every time. The flamingo manager is a static class. The SCP 1507 are made so that a lot of them can be handled. As such, they contain close to no logic and have no way to switch from one state to the other without the Flamingo Manager.
